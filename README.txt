Time optimal problem:
The program solves the problem of finding of minimum time (in [0,T]) in which the system moves
 from the initial set into the target set.

System is linear, two-dimensional: dx/dt = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t) + f(t),
Initial set is a ball with radius r,
Target set is conv(q1,q2,q3,q4), q1,q2,q3,q4 in R^2

In the first section you may choose one of the examples or set parametres by yourself.
After you may run the program. After end of it's work you may change parametres of accuracy.
